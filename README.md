unofficial_vasm_backup
======================

Backup of the vasm project. Ease my work on patches.

 * Master branch is a clone of the public daily snapshot of vasm. However it is not daily updated.
 * The other branch contain only work in progress patches
 * I am mainly interested in improving the support of the z80 cpu and oldstyle syntax
 * this project aims at testing vasm (z80/oldstyle) but can easily be adapted to any assembler or flavour of vasm: https://github.com/rgiot/vasm_z80_oldstyle_eval
